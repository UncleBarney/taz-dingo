##Development note
* **Source tree**
	* master - The default branch

* **Dependency management**
	* Maven shall be used for dependency management

* **Work with github**
There are two ways to collaborate with github. You can fork the project to your account, or work within the private repository in a different branch. I would suggest you to fork the project to your account, because that's easier.
	* Fork the project
		* Fork the project or a branch to your github account.
		* Make changes to the code.
		* Make a pull request to merge your contribution back to the original project
	* Work within the private repository
		* clone the private repository
 		* make a branch
		* work on the branch
		* push the branch to the private repository
		* goto GitHub and create a pull request from the branch on the private repository
		* someone else reviews the the pull request and decides to merge it with master on GitHub
		* delete the branch unless there was a problem and it was not merged then go back to #3

##Important notice
* *This repository is intended to help us collaborate, but not with other people. So, please don't fork the project to your public repositories nor publish the code.*
